# Leetcode Challenges üöÄ

Welcome to my repository of Leetcode challenges! This is where I document my solutions to coding problems from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, explore different algorithms and data structures, and keep track of my progress.

## Repository Structure üìÇ

The repository is organized as follows:
- **`/easy/`**: Solutions to Easy-level problems
- **`/medium/`**: Solutions to Medium-level problems
- **`/hard/`**: Solutions to Hard-level problems

Each folder contains files named as `problem_name-problem_id.extension` (e.g., `two_sum-001.py`), along with comments explaining the approach and logic behind the solution.

## Topics Covered üìö
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- And more!
